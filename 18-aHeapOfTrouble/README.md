I have a French AP next week and a Fiction Writing Contest piece that I am working on. I eventually got sick of French half way through the period and began working on my piece. It's not an AP but I feel like it was some time well spent. I read a few examples of perfect essays for the writing portion of French and wrote an outline for one of the prompts. I also read some of the grading rubric.
